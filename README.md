# Sentiment-Analysis-Classifier
Sentiment Analysis Classifier for CL Coursework 
\t

There are three Jupyter notebook files in this repository. Classic_Project.ipynb is a white-space tokenised classifier, Tokenized_Project.ipynb is a punctuation tokenised classifier, and Stopword_Project.ipynb is a classifer where the stop-words have been excluded from the vocabulary. All three files use logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent to train the models. Compiled_Reviews.txt is the dataset of Amazon reviews that have been used for the purpose of this experiment. However, in the models, this dataset is imported from another github repo. I have also included the list of stop-words that are used in Stopword_Project.ipynb. It has been taken from an NLTK list of stopwords, which is the NLTK_stopwords.txt file.
